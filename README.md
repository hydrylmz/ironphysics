# ironphysics
A 2D physics engine written from scratch in Rust.

This repository documents my journey building a physics engine to deeply understand:

- Simulation architecture
- Memory safety
- Deterministic systems
- Engine design

## Roadmap

- [ ] Math Core
- [ ] Rigid Body System
- [ ] Simulation Loop
- [ ] Collision Detection
- [ ] Spatial Partitioning
- [ ] Rendering
